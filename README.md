This repository contains scripts to extract audio features from MP3 files, download audio files from YouTube, and build machine learning models to predict various attributes of songs.

## Files:

### DataFeaturing.py ðŸŽ§

This script extracts audio features from MP3 files present in the 'musical' directory using the Librosa library.

#### Dependencies:
- Librosa
- csv
- os

#### Usage:
- Ensure MP3 files are present in the 'musical' directory.
- Run `DataFeaturing.py`.

### DataDownload.py ðŸ“¥

This script downloads audio files from YouTube based on track names provided in a CSV file.

#### Dependencies:
- youtube_dl
- csv

#### Usage:
- Provide the path to the CSV file containing track names and specify the column name.
- Run `DataDownload.py`.

### model.py ðŸ¤–

This script builds Random Forest Regressor models to predict various attributes of songs using the extracted audio features.

#### Dependencies:
- pandas
- scikit-learn

#### Usage:
- Ensure 'audio_features.csv' file is present (output of DataFeaturing.py).
- Run `model.py`.

### audio_features.csv ðŸ“Š

This CSV file contains extracted audio features of songs. It serves as input for building machine learning models.

## Usage:

1. Run `DataFeaturing.py` to extract audio features from MP3 files.
2. Run `DataDownload.py` to download audio files from YouTube based on track names.
3. Run `model.py` to build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting song attributes.

## Additional Notes:

- **Author**: Soujash Banerjee
- **College**: Institute of Engineering Management
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Note**: The following hasn't yet been converted into an API.

- The models were built using the scikit-learn library.
- Random Forest Regressor (RFR) ensemble models were utilized for prediction tasks.
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the scripts.
- Make sure to adjust file paths and column names as per your data structure.
- For detailed instructions on each script, refer to their respective sections above.
